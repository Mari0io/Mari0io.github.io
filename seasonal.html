              <p>
                <b>Early Bloomers</b> Daffodils are among the first flowers to bloom after winter, making them a cheerful sign that spring has arrived. Their bright yellow, white, and orange hues bring warmth and life to gardens after the cold months.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Resilient</b>  Daffodils can survive cold temperatures and even light snow, making them ideal for early spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Low Maintenance</b> Once planted, daffodils return year after year without needing replanting. Over time, they multiply naturally, creating larger and more impressive floral displays each season without much effort.
               </p>
               <p> 
                <b>Adaptable to Various Conditions</b> Daffodils can thrive in a wide range of soil types, as long as there is good drainage. They grow well in full sun to partial shade, making them versatile for different garden settings.

              <p><b>Pollinator Superstars</b> As one of the last major nectar sources before winter, goldenrods support bees, butterflies, and other pollinators when most other flowers have faded. Monarch butterflies rely on goldenrod nectar during their fall migration. </p>
              <p><b>Golden Color for the Autumn Season</b> Goldenrods bloom in late summer and last well into autumn, providing a burst of rich golden-yellow hues that complement fall foliage. Their warm, sunny tones contrast beautifully with reds, oranges, and deep purples in autumn landscapes. </p>
              <p><b> Great for Natural Landscaping</b> Goldenrods work well in meadows, cottage gardens, and roadside plantings. They blend beautifully with other fall perennials like asters, coneflowers, and ornamental grasses.</p>
